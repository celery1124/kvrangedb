  This interface initializes a device (controller) with a given information and returns a device handle (kv_device_handle *). The dev_init can be NULL. The implementation is vendor and device specific. If the initialization fails, it returns an error code, KV_ERR_DEVICE_INIT. For example, kv_initialize_device() used in a kernel driver can initialize HW queues, scan namespaces, and build internal data structures. If a device is initialized more than once, the subsequent calls fail and returns an error, KV_ERR_DEV_INITIALIZED.

  A device can be removed from a system by calling kv_cleanup_device().

/**
  kv_sanitize
  \ingroup device_interfaces

  This interface shall post an operation to a submission queue to start a sanitize operation for the device. The sanitize operation types that may be supported are KV_ERASE, CRYPTO_ERASE, and Overwrite. This routines are processed in the background (i.e., completion of the kv_sanitize command does not indicate completion of the sanitize operation).
  While a sanitize operation is in progress, all controllers in the device shall abort any command not allowed during a sanitize operation with a status of Sanitize In Progress. After a sanitize operation fails, all controllers in the device shall abort any command not allowed during a sanitize operation with a status of Sanitize FAILED until a subsequent sanitize operation is started or successful recovery from the failed sanitize operation occurs.
  
  The precise behavior of this interface is determined by the options set by users. 
  * KV_SANITIZE_OPT_KV_ERASE [DEFAULT, MANDATORY]: this alters all user data (i.e., key-value pairs) with a low-level block erase method that is specific to the media within the device in which user data may be stored. 
  * KV_SANITIZE_OPT_CRYPTO_ERASE: this sanitize operation alters user data by changing the media encryption keys for all user data on the media within the device in which user data may be stored.
  * KV_SANITIZE_OPT_OVERWRITE: The Overwrite sanitize operation alters all user data by writing a fixed data pattern specified in kv_sanitize_pattern.pattern to all locations on the media within the device in which user data may be stored one or more times. 
  
  Overwrite patten is defined in kv_sanitize_pattern data structure that includes patten length and pattern (section5.4.12).
  
  If a user defines an interrupt handler (i.e., kv_set_interrupt_handler()) and a postprocess function (i.e., post_fn), the interrupt handler will call the postprocess function when the device triggers an interrupt to notify the completion of the operation. If no postprocess function is defined, the interrupt handler just finishes its operation. If no interrupt handler is defined but a postprocess function is defined, the function is ignored.
  
  If a postprocess function (i.e., post_fn) is defined, the interrupt handler (an interrupt handler defined by kv_set_interrupt_handler()) or the poller (kv_poll_completion()) will call the postprocess function when the device triggers an interrupt to notify the completion of the operation or when the poller detects that the device finished the specified operation.
  
  PARAMETERS

  The precise behavior of this interface is determined by the option set by users. 
  * KV_PURGE_OPT_DEFAULT [MANDATORY]: this removes all key-value pairs. No secure erase is required
  * KV_PURGE_OPT_KV_ERASE: this removes all key-value pairs and includes secure erase. Cryptographic erase may be performed if all data is encrypted
  * KV_PURGE_OPT_CRYPT_ERASE: this cryptographically erases all key-value pairs. This is accomplished by deleting the encryption key
  
  This operation is not atomic.
  
  If a user defines an interrupt handler (i.e., kv_set_interrupt_handler()) and a postprocess function (i.e., post_fn), the interrupt handler will call the postprocess function when the device triggers an interrupt to notify the completion of the operation. If no postprocess function is defined, the interrupt handler just finishes its operation. If no interrupt handler is defined but a postprocess function is defined, the function is ignored.

  kv_open_iterator

  This interface enables users to set up a group of keys such that they can be iterated within a namespace. In other words, kv_open_iterator() enables a device to prepare a group of keys for iteration by matching given bit pattern (kv_group_condition.bit_pattern) to all keys in the namespace considering bits indicated by kv_group_condition.bitmask. It also sets up the iterator option; kv_iterator_next() will retrieve only keys when kv_iterator_option is KV_ITERATOR_OPT_KEY while kv_iterator_next() will retrieve key and value pairs when kv_iterator_option is KV_ITERATOR_OPT_KV.
  
  If a user defines an interrupt handler (i.e., kv_set_interrupt_handler()) and a postprocess function (i.e., post_fn), the interrupt handler will call the postprocess function when the device triggers an interrupt to notify the completion of the operation. If no postprocess function is defined, the interrupt handler just finishes its operation. If no interrupt handler is defined but a postprocess function is defined, the function is ignored.
  
  If a postprocess function (i.e., post_fn) is defined, the interrupt handler (an interrupt handler defined by kv_set_interrupt_handler()) or the poller (kv_poll_completion()) will call the postprocess function when the device triggers an interrupt to notify the completion of the operation or when the poller detects that the device finished the specified operation.
  
  Once an IO successfully completes, kv_iterator_handle is returned.

/**
 \ingroup Completion Interfaces
  kv_poll_completion

  This interface actively checks if any posted operations completes for a given timeout period in a caller thread context. If no operation is ready for the period, it returns with an error, KV_ERR_TIMEOUT. If there are operations completed, the completed handles are returned via op_hdls and the number of handles are set to hdl_cnt. If more operations than hdl_cnt are ready, it returns KV_WRN_MORE. If timeout_usec is set zero, it returns immediately.
  
  If a postprocess function (i.e., post_fn) is defined, the poller (kv_poll_completion()) may call the postprocess function when the poller detects that the device finished the specified operation.
  
  PARAMETERS
  IN que_hdl	queue handle
  IN timeout_usec	timeout in micro-seconds
  IN/OUT num_events	the maxiumum number of I/O completion events to retrieve needs to be set in an input and the number of completed I/O events is returned as an output
  
  RETURNS
  KV_SUCCESS
  
  KV_WRN_MORE		there are more completed operations
  KV_WRN_OVERWRITTEN		this store operation overwrote a mutable object created by kv_append()
  
  ERROR CODE
  KV_ERR_DEV_CAPACITY		device does not have enough space to create a namespace.
  KV_ERR_DEV_NOT_EXIST 		no device exists
  KV_ERR_KEY_COUNT_MISMATCH	key count specified does not match the number of keys in the key list
  KV_ERR_KEY_EXIST			the given key is already exists (with KV_STORE_IDEMPOTENT option)
  KV_ERR_KEY_INVALID		key format is invalid, or kv_key->key buffer is null
  KV_ERR_KEY_NOT_EXIST		given key does not exist (unmapped-read error)
  KV_ERR_KEY_LENGTH_INVALID	the key length is out of range of kv_device.min_key_len and kv_device.max_key_len
  KV_ERR_NS_NOT_EXIST		the namespace does not exist
  KV_ERR_OFFSET_INVALID		the offset is out of the value range 
  KV_ERR_OPTION_INVALID		the device does not support the specified options
  KV_ERR_PAIR_ATOMIC		this object is not created by a kv_append operation and cannot be modified
  KV_ERR_QUEUE_QID_INVALID	submission queue identifier is invalid
  KV_ERR_SYS_IO 			the host failed to communicate with the device
  KV_ERR_SYS_PERMISSION 		this caller does not have a permission to call this interface
  KV_ERR_TIMEOUT			timer expired and no operation is completed yet.
  KV_ERR_VALUE_LENGTH_INVALID	the value length is out of range of kv_device.min_value_len and kv_device.max_value_len
  KV_ERR_VENDOR			vendor-specific error is returned, check the system log for more details
  
  [SAMSUNG]
  KV_ERR_SEC_MISALIGNMENT	kv_samsung_device.append_unit is defined, and the size of value is not aligned

/**
  kv_set_interrupt_handler

  This interface is called by an interrupt process thread when an interrupt is triggered by a device when any posted operations complete. Its implementation is vendor-specific.
  
  If a user defines an interrupt handler (i.e., kv_set_interrupt_handler()) and a postprocess function (i.e., post_fn), the interrupt handler will call the postprocess function when the device triggers an interrupt to notify the completion of the operation. If no postprocess function is defined, the interrupt handler just finishes its operation. If no interrupt handler is defined but a postprocess function is defined, the function is ignored.
  
  If a postprocess function (i.e., post_fn) is defined, the interrupt handler (an interrupt handler defined by kv_set_interrupt_handler()) may call the postprocess function when the device triggers an interrupt to notify the completion of the operation.
  
  PARAMETERS
  IN que_hdl	queue handle
  IN int_hdl		an interrupt handler
  
  RETURNS
  KV_SUCCESS
  
  ERROR CODE
  KV_ERR_DEV_NOT_EXIST 		no device exists
  KV_ERR_QUEUE_QID_INVALID	submission queue identifier is invalid
